# Checkers MCTS

This program is a test of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Algorithm. By using this algorithm, we can more efficiently figure out the best move to make in the course of a checkers game. Monte Carlo Tree Search is more efficient than Breadth-first search due to the exploration of "promising" branches rather than every branch equally. MCTS searches promising moves more often than non-promising moves and then selects the branch with the most searches (because it is the most promising) and then selects the branch with the most searches.
